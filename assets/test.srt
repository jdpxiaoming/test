My grandmather used to tell me stories about the old days

6
00:00:15,845 --> 00:00:17,305
the time of piece

7
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:21,334
when the avator kept the balance between Water tribes, Earth kingdom,...

8
00:00:21,462 --> 00:00:23,646
Fire nation and Air nomads

9
00:00:24,181 --> 00:00:27,108
But that all changed when the Fire nation attacked

10
00:00:30,821 --> 00:00:34,116
Only the avatar mastered all four elements

11
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,585
only he can stop the troops of firebenders

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,280
when the world needed him most, he vanished

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,118
A hundred years have past, and the Fire nation is nearing victory in the war

14
00:00:49,227 --> 00:00:52,403
2 years ago, my father and the men of my tribe journied to...

15
00:00:52,404 --> 00:00:55,360
...the Earth kingdom to help fighting against the Fire nation

16
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:58,023
leaving my brother and me to look after our tribe

17
00:00:59,345 --> 00:01:03,584
some people believed the avatar was never reborn into the air nomads

18
00:01:03,824 --> 00:01:07,222
and his psycho was broken. But I have lots of hope

19
00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:13,147
I still believe that somehow, the avatar will return to save the world

It's not getting away from me this time.

24
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:03,030
Watch and learn, Katara. This is I catch the fish.

25
00:02:13,114 --> 00:02:15,257
Sokka, look!

26
00:02:15,457 --> 00:02:18,560
Sh~, Katara, you gonna scared it away

27
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,198
Um, I can hardly smell it cooked

28
00:02:21,253 --> 00:02:23,406
But Sokka, I caught one.

29
00:02:26,517 --> 00:02:28,500
-Hey.
-Ha.

30
00:02:28,795 --> 00:02:33,723
Why is it that everytime you play with magic water, I get soak

31
00:02:34,096 --> 00:02:37,701
Ah,It's not magic, it's waterbinding

32
00:02:37,702 --> 00:02:38,730
-and it is...
-yeah, yeah

35
00:02:46,098 --> 00:02:47,801
Here calling me weird.

36
00:02:48,267 --> 00:02:52,743
I'm not the one who makes the muscles at myself everytime my see my reflection in the water

37
00:02:55,388 --> 00:02:56,324
AHHH

38
00:03:08,829 --> 00:03:10,004
Watch out!

39
00:03:11,364 --> 00:03:13,028
Go left! Go left!

40
00:03:25,468 --> 00:03:26,685
You call that left!

41
00:03:26,751 --> 00:03:27,934
You don't like my steering. Well,

42
00:03:27,935 --> 00:03:31,530
maybe you should waterbinder us out of the ice

43
00:03:31,531 --> 00:03:34,228
-So it's my fault.
-I knew I should left you home

44
00:03:34,398 --> 00:03:36,981
Leave to a girl to screw things up.

45
00:03:38,807 --> 00:03:46,044
You're the most success amateur,not brained, I'm embarrassed to related to you

46
00:03:47,949 --> 00:03:53,706
Ever since mum died, I've doing all the work around camp, while you've been playing a soldier

47
00:03:53,903 --> 00:03:57,118
-Katara~
-I even wash all the clothes

48
00:03:57,646 --> 00:04:03,255
Have you ever smell your dirty socks? Let me tell you. Let me!

49
00:04:03,353 --> 00:04:07,679
-Katara, slow down.
-No. That's it. I'm done helping you!

50
00:04:08,184 --> 00:04:10,855
From now on, you're on your own.

51
00:04:23,921 --> 00:04:28,596
-OK, you've gone from weird to freakish, Katara.
-You mean I did that?

52
00:04:28,597 --> 00:04:31,523
yep, congratulations!

53
00:05:03,724 --> 00:05:06,377
He is alive, we have to help.

54
00:05:06,716 --> 00:05:10,401
Katara, get back here. We don't know what that thing is.

55
00:05:44,025 --> 00:05:47,729
Finally. Uncle, do you realize what this means?

56
00:05:48,331 --> 00:05:53,618
-I want get finished my game.
-It means my search is about to coming to a end.

57
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,664
That light came from an incredible powerful source, it has to be him

58
00:06:00,845 --> 00:06:06,909
It just a slice of your lights, we've been down this road before, Prince Zuko.

59
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:10,793
I don't want you to get too excited over nothing.

60
00:06:11,086 --> 00:06:17,730
Please sit. Why don't you enjoy a cup of calming jessamin tea?

61
00:06:17,842 --> 00:06:21,930
I don't need any calming tea, I need to capture the avatar.

62
00:06:21,931 --> 00:06:24,811
Helmsman, head across for the light

63
00:06:44,136 --> 00:06:45,344
STOP£¡

64
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:01,978
Stop it!

65
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:16,841
-I need to ask you something.
-What?

66
00:07:17,356 --> 00:07:20,526
-Please come closer.
-What is is?

67
00:07:22,694 --> 00:07:24,403
Will you go Panwing sailing with me?

68
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:27,542
Er, sure, I guess

69
00:07:28,376 --> 00:07:31,882
-What's going on here?
-You tell us!

70
00:07:31,883 --> 00:07:35,121
How did you get into the ice, and why aren't you frozen

71
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:37,472
I'm not sure.

72
00:07:43,501 --> 00:07:44,856
Appa!

73
00:07:44,857 --> 00:07:48,519
Are you alright? Weak up, buddy!

74
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,744
Hey, you're OK!

75
00:08:06,828 --> 00:08:09,752
-What is that thing?
-This is Appa, my flying bison

76
00:08:09,753 --> 00:08:13,941
Right.And this is Katara, my flying sister.

77
00:08:25,325 --> 00:08:27,092
Don't worry. It will be washed out.

78
00:08:29,403 --> 00:08:32,440
-So, do you guys live around here.
-Don't answer that!

79
00:08:32,441 --> 00:08:36,129
Did you see that crazy ball of light, he probably try to signal to the fire, may be

80
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:41,864
Oh, ya, I'm sure he is the spy for the fire may be, you can tell by the evil looking in his eyes

81
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:49,219
-The pair annoyed one is my brother, Sakka. You never told your name.
-I'm...

82
00:09:02,546 --> 00:09:04,897
I'm Aang.

83
00:09:05,435 --> 00:09:10,835
-You just sneezed and flew 10 feet into the air.
-Really?It felt higher than that.

84
00:09:10,836 --> 00:09:12,826
Ah, you're an airbinder.

85
00:09:12,827 --> 00:09:18,900
-Sure I am.
-Jet light beams, flying bison, airbinders. I think I got midnight sun madness.

86
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:21,295
I'm going home to wash stuff, make sense.

87
00:09:25,688 --> 00:09:29,016
You guys are stuck, upon. I can give you a lift.

88
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,622
-We love a ride, thanks.

89
00:09:33,789 --> 00:09:37,295
Oh, no, I am not getting on that fluffy snore monster.

90
00:09:37,296 --> 00:09:41,507
Are you hoping some other kind of monster will come along, and give you a ride home

91
00:09:41,662 --> 00:09:45,438
... you know, before you freeze to death.
-Er...

92
00:09:48,734 --> 00:09:52,366
OK. First time flyer, hold on tight.

93
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:54,078
Up and yep yep!

94
00:10:03,372 --> 00:10:05,478
Come on,Appa. Yep, yep!

95
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:08,777
Wow, that was truely amazing!

96
00:10:08,914 --> 00:10:13,067
Appa is just tired, a little rest and he will be the throne in the sky. You will see.

97
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:21,134
-Why are you smiling at me like that?
-Oh, I was smiling?

98
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,331
I'm going to bed now.

99
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:45,675
Yep, a man needs his rest.

100
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:50,171
Prince Zuko, you need some sleep.

101
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:56,390
Even if you're right, and the avatar is alive, you won't find him.

102
00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:03,017
Your father, grand father, and great grand father all tried and failed.

103
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:08,004
Because their honor didn't hint the avatar 's capture, mine dose.

104
00:11:08,136 --> 00:11:11,079
This covered hundred years, and hiding are over.

105
00:11:22,054 --> 00:11:24,518
-Hey.
-Hey.

106
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:27,871
-What are you thinking about?
-I guess I was wandering...

107
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:32,306
you're being a airbinder and, or if you have any idea what happend to the avatar

108
00:11:33,415 --> 00:11:40,348
Er, no, I didn't know him. I mean I knew people that knew him. But I didn't. Sorry

109
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:44,749
-OK, just curious. Good night.
-Sleep tight.

110
00:12:30,155 --> 00:12:32,661
Aang, Aang, wake up!

111
00:12:32,662 --> 00:12:38,257
It's OK. We are in the village now. Come on and get ready.Everyone is waiting to meet you.

112
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,555
Aang, this is the entire village. Entire village, Aang.

113
00:13:01,686 --> 00:13:05,385
Er, why are they all looking at me like that?

114
00:13:05,386 --> 00:13:10,117
-Did Appa sneeze on me?
-Well, no one has seen a airbinder in a 100 years.

115
00:13:10,118 --> 00:13:15,001
We thought they were extinct until my grand daughter and grand son found you.

116
00:13:15,834 --> 00:13:18,596
-Extinct?
-Aang, this is my grand mother.

117
00:13:18,762 --> 00:13:20,271
Call me Gran Gran.

118
00:13:21,054 --> 00:13:24,759
What is this? A weapon. You can't stab anything with this.

119
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:28,107
It's not for stabing, it's for airbinding.

120
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,008
Magic, do it again.

121
00:13:32,271 --> 00:13:37,700
Not magic, airbinding. It lets me control the air current around my glander(*) and fly

122
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:41,766
You know, last time I checked, humans can't fly

123
00:13:41,766 --> 00:13:43,760
Check again.

124
00:13:51,717 --> 00:13:53,133
It's amazing!

125
00:14:05,082 --> 00:14:07,443
Oh, my watch tower!

126
00:14:10,236 --> 00:14:12,544
That was amazing!

127
00:14:18,164 --> 00:14:23,787
Great, you're an airbinder, Katara is a waterbinder, together you can just waste time all day long.

128
00:14:24,045 --> 00:14:27,762
-You're a waterbinder.
-Well, sort of, not yet.

129
00:14:28,137 --> 00:14:32,183
Alright, no more playing. Come on, Katara, you have trouse.

130
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:37,576
I told you he was the real thing, Gran Gran. I finally found an airbinder to teach me.

131
00:14:37,758 --> 00:14:43,382
-Katara, try not put all your hopes in this boy.
-But he is special, I can tell.

132
00:14:43,576 --> 00:14:46,361
I sense he is filled with much them

133
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,502
See, ... my tongue... is...can look like this

134
00:14:57,365 --> 00:14:59,888
Again!

135
00:15:04,135 --> 00:15:10,501
No, power in firebinding comes from the breath, not the muscles.

136
00:15:11,272 --> 00:15:19,618
The breath becomes energy in the body, the energy extends past your limbs and becomes fire.

137
00:15:20,035 --> 00:15:22,866
-Get right this time.
-Enough.

138
00:15:22,867 --> 00:15:27,377
I've been drilling this sequence all day, teach me the next set, I'm more than ready.

139
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:32,317
-No, you're inpatient. You have to master your basics.

140
00:15:32,318 --> 00:15:33,542
Drill it again.

141
00:15:37,551 --> 00:15:44,222
The say just tell us the avatar is the last airbinder, he must be over 100 years old by now.

142
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:49,822
He had a century to master the 4 elements, I'll need more than basic firebinding to defeat him.

143
00:15:49,883 --> 00:15:53,306
You will teach me the advanced set.

144
00:15:54,077 --> 00:15:59,476
Very well, but first I must finish my roast duck.

145
00:16:03,633 --> 00:16:07,850
Now, man, it's important that you show no fear when you face a firebinder.

146
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:11,192
In the water tribe, We fight to the last man standing.

147
00:16:11,193 --> 00:16:14,840
For with our courage, all we can call ourselves men.

148
00:16:17,582 --> 00:16:24,200
-I gotta pee.
-Listen, until your father return from the war, there accounting you to the man in the strib.

149
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,654
And that means no party breaks.

150
00:16:26,654 --> 00:16:32,003
-But I really gotta go.
-OK, who else to go?

151
00:16:36,012 --> 00:16:40,410
Have you seen Aang? Gran Gran said he dispeared over an hour ago.

152
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,496
Wow, everyting freezes in the air

153
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:49,283
Katara.Get him out of here. This lesson is for warriors only.

154
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,362
Stop, stop it right now.

155
00:16:58,048 --> 00:17:01,600
What's wrong with you. We don't have time for fun and games with the war going on.

156
00:17:02,114 --> 00:17:05,400
What war? What are you talking about?

157
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,411
-You're kiding, right?
-Pangwing!

158
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,541
He is kiding, right?

159
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:28,064
-Aang?
-Hey, come on, little guy!

160
00:17:28,272 --> 00:17:30,064
Wanna go a flating?

161
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:36,282
I'll weave as animals, KA KA

162
00:17:39,118 --> 00:17:43,494
Aang, I will help you catch a Panwing if you teach me waterbinding.

163
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:49,789
You got a deal. Just one little problem, I'm an airbinding, not a waterbinding.

164
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,796
Is there someone in your tribe can teach you?

165
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,634
No, you're looking at the only waterbinder in the whole south pole.

166
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,986
This is not right. A waterbinder needs to ask water.

167
00:18:01,441 --> 00:18:06,168
What about the north pole, there's another water tribe over there, right?

168
00:18:06,455 --> 00:18:09,432
-Maybe there waterbinder can teach you.
-May be.

169
00:18:09,863 --> 00:18:12,997
But we have not contected the sister-tribe for a long time.

170
00:18:13,275 --> 00:18:17,750
It's not exactly turn right at the second leisure, it's on the other side of the world.

171
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:23,565
But you forget. I have a flying bison. Appa and I can personly fly you to the north pole.

172
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:29,692
-Katara, we gonna find you a master.
-That's... I mean, I don't know.

173
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:31,454
I've never leave my home before.

174
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:36,830
Well, you think about it. But at mean time, can you teach me how to catch one of these Panwings.

175
00:18:37,112 --> 00:18:44,815
OK. Listen closely my young pupil. Catch Panwing is an ancient and secret art. Observe.

176
00:19:13,381 --> 00:19:16,996
-I haven't done this since I was kid.
-We still are kids.

177
00:19:39,155 --> 00:19:42,117
Wow, what is that?

178
00:19:42,117 --> 00:19:47,324
A fire nabe ship and a very bad memory for my people.

179
00:19:50,248 --> 00:19:55,336
Aang, stop. We're not aloud to go near it. The ship could be booby trap.

180
00:19:55,336 --> 00:19:59,273
If you want to be a binder, you have to let go off fear.

181
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:51,461
This ship has hang to my tribe since my Gran Gran was a little girl. It was the part of Fire nation's first attacks.

182
00:20:51,605 --> 00:20:58,829
OK. Backup. I have friends all over the world, even in the Fire nation. I have never seen any wars.

183
00:20:58,829 --> 00:21:04,366
-Aang. How long were you in that iceberg.
-I don't know. A few days, maybe.

184
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:12,177
-I think it was more like 100 years.
-What? That's impossible. Do I look like a 120-year man to you?

185
00:21:12,379 --> 00:21:16,998
Think about it. The war is a century old. You don't know about it because...

186
00:21:17,295 --> 00:21:22,469
somehow you were in there that whole time. That's the only explaination.

187
00:21:24,817 --> 00:21:33,177
-100 years. I can't believe it.
-I'm sorry, Aang. Maybe somehow there is a brightsight to all this.

188
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:38,972
-I dig it to meet you.
-Come on. Let's get out of here.

189
00:21:44,991 --> 00:21:48,142
Aang, let's head back. This place is crapy.

190
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,390
What that you said about booby traps?

191
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:09,998
Hold on tight.

192
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:25,980
The last airbinder. Quite out gel for * age.

193
00:22:26,075 --> 00:22:31,672
Wake my uncle. Tell him I found the avatar, ...

194
00:22:37,021 --> 00:22:39,789
...as well as his hiding place.

195
00:22:42,966 --> 00:22:46,122
To be continued.
